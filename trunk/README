    -k fast SSL/TLS sweep
        Some SSL/TLS services don't respond with errors so we assume its
        an UNSUPPORTED cipher. To complicate matters, some Apache web servers
        respond with an ASCII error text message so we can't check if we are
        really talking to an SSL/TLS service.

        So we'll use a cautious flag. If the flag is set, we'll stop scanning,
        if the returned data does not match standard SSL/TLS data. 
    
        Note: The default will be to scan all ciphers in the chosen/default
        ciphers file.
