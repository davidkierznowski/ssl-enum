= Introduction =

SSL-Enum is a standalone SSL/TLS scanner.

SSL-Enum was developed due to the lack of tools available that perform SSL cipher enumeration without requiring OpenSSL or SSLeay.

Please be aware the tools is still very much BETA and contributing is welcome and encouraged.

= Portability =
ssl-enum should compile on any ANSI C compatible system. It has compiled and run on the following platforms:
   * Linux 2.6.15-23-386
   * Windows Vista Home Edition (with CYGWIN)


= Installation = 
$ make

= Usage = 
$ ./ssl-enum -s 127.0.0.1 -p 443 (opt: -vf)
    -v 1
        Level 1 debugging will print SSL server errors if available.
    -v 2
        Level 2 debugging will print read and write data.
    -f filename
        Allows alternate ciphers file. The default is cipher-list.txt.
    -k fast SSL/TLS sweep
        Some SSL/TLS services don't respond with errors so we assume its
        an UNSUPPORTED cipher. To complicate matters, some Apache web servers
        respond with an ASCII error text message so we can't check if we are
        really talking to an SSL/TLS service.

        So we'll use a cautious flag. If the flag is set, we'll stop scanning,
        if the returned data does not match standard SSL/TLS data.

        Note: The default will be to scan all ciphers in the chosen/default 
        ciphers file.
